Below records some backlog items this blog site should cover in the future:

1. What is storage service? What's the difference between S3, EBS, DW and other AWS storage services? What's the challenge when design/provide/maintain storage services?
2. How does the software architecture evolve? What's the difference and pros/cons between Monolithic, SOA, Microservices and FaaS? And what's the future architecture beyond that?
3. What is serverless? What's the benefits and concerns it brings to our daily development?
4. Relational DBMS vs. Non-Relational DBMS, what to choose and why? (Ref link: https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/dynamodb-no-bad-queries/)
